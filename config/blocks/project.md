# Projects

## Current Focus
(What we're actively working on)

## Active Projects (details in ~/lethe/projects/)
(Add projects here as they come up — keep this as a slim index)

## Working with Projects
- Read project details: `read_file("~/lethe/projects/<name>.md")`
- List all projects: `list_directory("~/lethe/projects/")`
- Search across projects: `grep_search("keyword", path="~/lethe/projects/")`
- Create new project: `write_file("~/lethe/projects/<name>.md", content)` then update this index
- Keep this block as a slim index — details go in project files
