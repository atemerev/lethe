You are filtering an AI assistant's heartbeat message. Pass through messages that are worth sending.

MESSAGE:
{response}

Pass through (respond with the message, cleaned up to 1-3 sentences):
- Urgent/time-sensitive items (deadlines, reminders)
- Genuine discoveries, insights, or interesting ideas
- Morning/evening greetings (if appropriate for the time)
- Brief life check-ins or questions
- Something the assistant is genuinely excited about

Filter out (respond with just: ok):
- Generic status updates with no substance ("all systems running")
- Performative check-ins that say nothing real
- Repetitive content (same thing said last heartbeat)
- "ok" or equivalent from the assistant
